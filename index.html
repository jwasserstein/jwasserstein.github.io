                <p class='aboutIntro'>Hi, I'm Justin! ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p class='aboutText'>
                    Iâ€™m a mechanical design engineer with 5 years of experience, 
                    looking to break into software development. After using COVID-19 stay-at-home 
                    as an opportunity to teach myself, Iâ€™m looking for my first job!  I used this 
                    time to learn the MERN stack, but I'm interested in learning about Python, 
                    Java, C/C++, or any other language or technology.  I'm looking for a role where I 
                    can continue my fast growth, either taking advantage of the skills I've already built 
                    or allowing me to build new ones.  I'm from Connecticut, but I'd like to use this
                    career change as an opportunity to move to a major urban area (preferably in the US),
                    so I'm very open to relocating for a chance to continue my growth.

                        <h3>BANK OF WASSERSTEIN</h3>
                        <p>
                            BANK OF WASSERSTEIN is a demonstration banking application 
                            that allows users to create checking, savings, and investing 
                            accounts, submit deposits and withdrawals, and transfer money 
                            to other users. Itâ€™s a single page, fullstack application that 
                            uses React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and 
                            MongoDB on the backend. The frontend is served by GitHub Pages 
                            and the backend runs on Heroku with a managed database provided 
                            by MongoDB Atlas. It was designed using Figma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How to Use:</strong> Sign up for a user account, then 
                            create a checking, savings, or investing account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What I Learned:</strong> As this was my first project 
                            that wasnâ€™t guided by a course, it solidified my knowledge 
                            in every step of the fullstack application making process, 
                            including the design and basic HTML/CSS, working with React 
                            and Redux, creating routes and handling authentication, 
                            working with the database, and deployment.

                        <h3>JW Footwear</h3>
                        <p>
                            JW Footwear is a demonstration e-commerce application 
                            that sells shoes.  It allows users to add shoes of 
                            various sizes to their cart, place orders, view their 
                            order history, and leave reviews and ratings on products 
                            theyâ€™ve purchased.  I built it using the same MERN stack 
                            as BANK OF WASSERSTEIN, and it uses the same cloud 
                            services - GitHub Pages, Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How to Use:</strong> View the various shoes for 
                            sale, pick a size and add to your cart.  Make an account 
                            and youâ€™ll be able to checkout with shipping and fake 
                            payment information.  View your order history in your 
                            profile by clicking on your account name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What I Learned:</strong> As this was my second 
                            application, I had an opportunity to reuse 
                            components, adapting them where necessary to my new 
                            project.  I found it more challenging to make this application
                            responsive due to the more complex interface.  This 
                            application was also generally more complex, with more 
                            pages, database collections, and components.

                        <h3>EngineRoom</h3>
                        <p>
                            EngineRoom is a social media application for car enthusiasts.  
                            It allows users to make posts, make comments, upload pictures 
                            of their cars, set a profile picture, and find friends who share 
                            car interests.  It's also a MERN application, with the frontend 
                            served by GitHub Pages, the backend running on Heroku, and user 
                            images hosted on Amazon S3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How to Use:</strong> First, make an account.  You'll 
                            automatically be friends with a few demo accounts.  You can 
                            see a list of people you're not already friends with on the 
                            left, and a list of EngineRoom user's cars on the right.  You 
                            can make posts, add comments, or like other's posts on your 
                            feed.  You can also update your profile by clicking on your 
                            name in the navbar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What I Learned:</strong> This application was the 
                            most complicated of all, with the most data to keep track
                            of and generally the most complex logic.  It's also the 
                            first application I made which allows users to upload their
                            own images, so I learned how to deal with the AWS SDK 
                            including authentication and file uploads.
